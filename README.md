# PowerplantCC

## Welcome !
This is my solution to the powerplant coding challenge.

## Build & run the project
Follow the steps below to build and run the project:
    1. Clone the git repo
    2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
    3. Make sure the 'https' launch profile is selecten
    4. Start the PowerplantCC.API project
    5. A browserwindow with the swaggerUI should open and the API should be running on port 8888 as defined in the LaunchSettings.json

Alternetively you can also start a cmd prompt in the PowerplantCC.API folder and run the dotnet run command.

You can test out the API by sending a POST request to https://localhost:8888/api/productionplan.
Included is also a test project with some basic unit tests.
